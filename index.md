## About Me

I'm a PhD student at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk) supervised by [Prof. Pheng-Ann Heng](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pheng/1.html). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interests include vision-language, large models, and 3D vision. 

## Research Interests
- **Manifold Learning:** positive semi-definite manifolds learning
- **Machine Learning:** fairness AI, penalization and augmentation methods
- **Functional Data Analysis:** functional regression, and clustering methods
- **High-Dimensional Statistics:** matrix-valued regression and clustering, positive semi-definite matrices estimations


## Awards
- **[May. 2023]** <a href="https://gsas.nyu.edu/admissions/financial-aid/graduate-school-fellowships-and-assistantships.html" target="_blank">*MacCracken Awards*</a> for outstanding research and activities
